# arsheadlines
This repository contains much of the work product for a series written for Ars Technica on applying machine learning using AWS SageMaker to the problem of predicting which headline from a pair will get more clicks.

ars-headline-tests-nofilter.csv contains the headline pairs, their click rates during the test period, and the certainty of the test based on Ars' existing headline selection test algorithm.
